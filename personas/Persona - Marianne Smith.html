                    Loves to gossip about her neighbors and play a Scrabble knock-off on her iPhone 6 plus

                <li>

                <li>
                    Rather frugal, but whenever her granddaughters stay the night, money is of no object.

                    Marianne tries her best to stay up to date, but this accelerating era has seemed to surpass her tech-saviness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Her granddaughter, Lizzy, often finds herself confused texts from Marianne like "H37 42vgb433uuuuuuuuupizza"
                </li>
                <li>
                    Marianne will often call her granddaughter Julia to ask her troubleshooting questions like "How do I make the <i>ding</i> play when I get an email message?" and "Why does everything on my phone turn sideways when I'm laying on my side? I think I was hacked this time."
                </li>
                <li>
                    Marianne is starting to have trouble seeing, but hasn't gotten around to getting contacts yet.
